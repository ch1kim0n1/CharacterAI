# List of things that AI will do

1. Generate a **3D model** of a waifu based on user preferences. Use of VTube Studio.
2. Incorporate a **chatbox interface** for users to interact with the waifu character. (Talk with her)
3. Utilize the **ChatGPT API** (Chai/Character.ai API later) to enable the character to respond to user inputs and engage in conversation.
4. Convert the textual output of the AI bot into speech using the **text-to-speech software**.
5. Enable the character to **audibly** articulate the generated response.
6. Synchronize the **lip movements** of the character with the output sound to create a more realistic and immersive interaction.


# How to run it (WITH 3D Model)

1. Required additional instalations: VTube Studio, OBS, VTS Desctop Audio(plugin)
2. Copy the resperatory anywhere locally
3. Install all of the neccessary libraries via terminal
4. In hidden.txt replace "API KEY HERE" with your OpenAI API Key

7. Run the Runner class (UserPersonalData.py)

# How to run it (WITHOUT 3D Model)
1. Required additional instalations: NONE
2. Copy the resperatory anywhere locally
3. Install all of the neccessary libraries via terminal
4. In hidden.txt replace "API KEY HERE" with your OpenAI API Key

# Potential Ideas/Features:
1. Add section with questions for user for AI to remember (name, age, hobbies)
2. make bot talk in more personal way than giving general answers
3. AI could adapt to user's responces + feedback system
4. recommendation system (movies, music, tv shows)
