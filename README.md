# List of things that AI will do

1. Generate a **3D model** of a waifu based on user preferences. Use of VTube Studio.
2. Incorporate a **chatbox interface** for users to interact with the waifu character. (Talk with her)
3. Utilize the **ChatGPT API** (Chai/Character.ai API later) to enable the character to respond to user inputs and engage in conversation.
4. Convert the textual output of the AI bot into speech using the **text-to-speech software**.
5. Enable the character to **audibly** articulate the generated response.
6. Synchronize the **lip movements** of the character with the output sound to create a more realistic and immersive interaction.




# Potential Ideas/Features:
1. Add section with questions for user for AI to remember (name, age, hobbies)
2. make bot talk in more personal way than giving general answers
3. AI could adapt to user's responces + feedback system
4. recommendation system (movies, music, tv shows)
5. ability to joke, flirt, and play games with the user
6. Internet access
7. personalized content (stories)
