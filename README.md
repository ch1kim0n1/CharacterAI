# CharacterAI

List of things that AI will do

1. Generate a **3D model** of a waifu based on user preferences. Use of VTube Studio.
2. Incorporate a **chatbox interface** for users to interact with the waifu character. (Talk with her)
3. Utilize the** ChatGPT API**(Chai/Character.ai API later) to enable the character to respond to user inputs and engage in conversation.
4. Convert the textual output of the AI bot into speech using the **text-to-speech software**.
5. Enable the character to **audibly** articulate the generated response.
6. Synchronize the **lip movements** of the character with the output sound to create a more realistic and immersive interaction.
